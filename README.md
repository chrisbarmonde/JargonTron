#Jargon Tron Readme
##Intro
JargonTron is a sports jargon generator that you can teach new phrases!
<br>
<br>
Note: In order to prevent people from abusing this bot and placing objectionable content, it only accepts content from people it follows. If you want to add to the bot, please hit up @DoHimJob.
##Format
JargonTron uses a MySQL database with three tables, Exclamation, Player, and Quip. It randomly selects an entry on each table to create a new garbage sports phrase, using this format: **Exclamation** Player *Quip*
<br>
<br>
Here are some example tweets I just generated:
<br>
* **Wow.** Derek Jeter *just has no hustle.* <br>
* **Huh.** Ty Cobb *can't dunk for shit.*<br>
* **Holy Shit!** Lionel Messi *is a shitty garbage golem*.

You get the idea.

##Adding Content
Want to add stuff to JargonTron? It's super easy! Just tweet: <br>

@JargonTron exc + GUH.<br>
@JargonTron player + Addie Joss <br>
@JargonTron quip + is a horrible turdlord. <br>

Jargon Tron will prune extra whitespace, though I recommend you end exclamations or quips with punctuation, and add no punctuation to players.

Go Nuts!

##Getting Jargon
JargonTron will randomly tweet out some jargon every so often, but you can also request some jargon by tweeting "@JargonTron hit me"!
